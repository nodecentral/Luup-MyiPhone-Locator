2. Upload the .xml and .json file in the repository to the appropriate storage location on your controller. For Vera that's via Apps/Develop Apps/Luup files/
3. Create the decice instance via the appropriate route. For Vera that's Apps/Develop Apps/Create Device/ and putting "D_MyiPhone1.xml" into the Upnp Device Filename box. 
4. Reload luup to establish the device and then reload luup again (just to be sure) and you should be good to go
5. Enter is all the required credentials which are your AppleID username and password, your home logitude and latitude coordinates and the name of the device you are looking to track (as registered with Apple)

You can configure it quickly by updating the following script and running it in the Lua Startup / Testing window.
````
local lul_device = 189  -- the registered device number of your plugin
local username = "myappleid@domain.com"  -- your AppleID username
local password = "myapplepw" -- your AppleID password
local device = "mydevicename" -- the name of you Apple registered device
local homelatitude = 0.00000
local homelongitude = 0.0000
local COM_SID = "urn:nodecentral-net:serviceId:MyiPhone1"

luup.variable_set(COM_SID, "MyAppleUsername", username , lul_device)
